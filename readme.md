# Leap Years

Leap Years is a simple program written in the esoteric language [ArnoldC](https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC). Its function is to determine if a year is a leap year.

## Usage
To use Leap Years, download the compiled `leap-years.class` file from the bin directory. `cd` to the parent directory and run `java leap-years`. You will be asked for a year and the program will tell you if it was a leap year or not.

**Note:** Leap years were not introduced until 1752, so any year before that will return false.
